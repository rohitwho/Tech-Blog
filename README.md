## Description
The given CMS-style blog site provides various functionalities and user interactions. When visiting the site for the first time, the homepage displays existing blog posts, if any, along with navigation links to the homepage and dashboard, and the option to log in. Clicking on the homepage link takes the user to the homepage, while clicking on other navigation links prompts the user to sign up or sign in.

Upon choosing to sign up, the user is prompted to create a username and password. Clicking the sign-up button saves the user credentials and logs them into the site. When revisiting the site later, the user can sign in by entering their username and password. Once signed in, the navigation displays links to the homepage, dashboard, and the option to log out.

Clicking on the homepage link while signed in leads to the homepage, where existing blog posts are shown with their titles and creation dates. Clicking on a blog post displays the title, contents, creator's username, and creation date, allowing the user to leave comments.

Signed-in users can access the dashboard, which shows their existing blog posts and the option to add a new post. Creating a new post requires entering a title and contents. Upon submission, the post is saved, and the user is taken back to an updated dashboard.

Within the dashboard, users can delete or update their existing posts. Clicking on the logout option in the navigation signs the user out. If the user is idle on the site for a specified duration, they can still view comments but are prompted to log in again before adding, updating, or deleting comments.
